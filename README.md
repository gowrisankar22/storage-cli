A unified command-line tool for interacting with multiple cloud storage providers through a single binary. The CLI supports five blob-storage providers (Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS, and WebDAV), each with its own client implementation while sharing a common command interface.

**Note:** This CLI works with existing storage resources (buckets, containers, etc.) that are already created and configured in your cloud provider. The storage bucket/container name and credentials must be specified in the provider-specific configuration file.

Key points

- Single binary with provider selection via `-s` flag.

- Each provider has its own directory (azurebs/, s3/, gcs/, alioss/, dav/) containing client implementations and configurations.

- All providers support the same core commands (put, get, delete, exists, list, copy, etc.).

- Provider-specific configurations are passed via JSON config files.


## Providers
- [Alioss](./alioss/README.md)
- [Azurebs](./azurebs/README.md)
- [Dav](./dav/README.md)
  - additional endpoints needed by CAPI still missing
- [GCS](./gcs/README.md)
- [S3](./s3/README.md)


## Build
Build the unified storage CLI binary:

```shell
go build -o storage-cli
```

Or with version information:
```shell
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=1.0.0" -o storage-cli
```

## Usage

The CLI uses a unified command structure across all providers:

```shell
storage-cli -s <provider> -c <config-file> <command> [arguments]
```

**Flags:**
- `-s`: Storage provider type (azurebs|s3|gcs|alioss|dav)
- `-c`: Path to provider-specific configuration file
- `-v`: Show version
- `-log-file`: Path to log file (optional, logs to stderr by default)
- `-log-level`: Logging level: debug, info, warn, error (default: warn)

**Common commands:**
- `put <path/to/file> <remote-object>` - Upload a local file to remote storage
- `get <remote-object> <path/to/file>` - Download a remote object to local file  
- `delete <remote-object>` - Delete a remote object
- `delete-recursive [prefix]` - Delete objects recursively. If prefix is omitted, deletes all objects
- `exists <remote-object>` - Check if a remote object exists (exits with code 3 if not found)
- `list [prefix]` - List remote objects. If prefix is omitted, lists all objects
- `copy <source-object> <destination-object>` - Copy object within the same storage
- `sign <object> <action> <duration_as_second>` - Generate signed URL (action: get|put, duration: e.g., 60s)
- `properties <remote-object>` - Display properties/metadata of a remote object
- `ensure-storage-exists` - Ensure the storage container/bucket exists, if not create the storage(bucket,container etc)

**Examples:**
```shell
# Upload file to S3
storage-cli -s s3 -c s3-config.json put local-file.txt remote-object.txt

# List GCS objects with prefix
storage-cli -s gcs -c gcs-config.json list my-prefix

# Check if Azure blob exists
storage-cli -s azurebs -c azure-config.json exists my-blob.txt

# Get properties of an object
storage-cli -s azurebs -c azure-config.json properties my-blob.txt

# Sign object for 'get' in alioss for 60 seconds
storage-cli -s alioss -c alioss-config.json sign object.txt get 60s

# Upload file with debug logging to file
storage-cli -s s3 -c s3-config.json -log-level debug -log-file storage.log put local-file.txt remote-object.txt

# List objects with error-level logging only
storage-cli -s gcs -c gcs-config.json -log-level error list my-prefix
```

## Contributing

Follow these steps to make a contribution to the project:

- Fork this repository
- Create a feature branch based upon the `main` branch (*pull requests must be made against this branch*)
  ``` bash
  git checkout -b feature-name origin/main
  ```
- Run tests to check your development environment setup
  ``` bash
  ginkgo --race --skip-package=integration --cover -v -r ./...
  ```
- Make your changes (*be sure to add/update tests*)
- Run tests to check your changes
  ``` bash
  ginkgo --race --skip-package=integration --cover -v -r ./...
  ```
- If you added or modified integration tests, to run them locally, follow the instructions in the provider-specific README (see [Providers](#providers) section)
- **Note:** Integration tests require access to cloud provider credentials. For fork PRs, a maintainer must approve the integration test run before they execute (see [Integration tests for fork PRs](#integration-tests-for-fork-prs)).
- Push changes to your fork
  ``` bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  git push origin feature-name
  ```
- Create a GitHub pull request, selecting `main` as the target branch

### Integration tests for fork PRs

Integration tests run automatically for PRs from within this repository. For fork PRs, each push triggers the integration test workflows, but they pause at an approval gate before executing.

> [!WARNING]
> @maintainers: Review the PR diff carefully before approving the integration test run to avoid leaking credentials. Approve via the **"Review deployments"** button that appears on the PR's Checks tab.

## Dependency Updates

This project uses [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to keep dependencies up to date. Dependencies are grouped (e.g., AWS SDK, Azure SDK, Google Cloud, testing tools) to reduce PR noise.

Dependabot PRs are merged automatically if they pass all required checks (tests and integration tests).

## Releases

### Automatic Weekly Releases

The workflow [Release Cron](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/storage-cli/actions/workflows/release-cron.yml) builds an automatic weekly patch release if there are changes on the `main` branch (e.g. version bumps).

The workflow builds and tests storage-cli, runs the integration tests and finally builds and publishes the new patch release. Note that published storage-cli releases are picked up by [capi-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release) automatically.

Disable the [Release Cron](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/storage-cli/actions/workflows/release-cron.yml) workflow (3 dot button on the right > Disable workflow) to stop automatic releases, e.g. in case of known bugs on main or when a new major/minor version shall be released manually.

### Manual Release
Releases must be triggered manually by an approver. This can be done either via `GitHub Actions` (workflow dispatch) or through the `GitHub Releases` page using the **Draft a new release** option. The *Release Manual* workflow is responsible for creating and completing the release.

Option 1: Release via Workflow Dispatch

- Go to Actions and select the *Release Manual* workflow.

- Click **Run workflow**.

- Enter the next incremented version number with the v prefix (for example, v1.2.3).

- The workflow will create the release and upload the build artifacts once completed.

Option 2: Release via Draft Release

- Go to Releases and click **Draft a new release**.

- Create a new tag using the next incremented version with the v prefix.

- Fill in the release title and description.

- Click Publish release.

- The release will appear immediately on the Releases page. This action will also trigger the *Release Manual* workflow, which will build the artifacts and upload them to the published release once the workflow finishes.
